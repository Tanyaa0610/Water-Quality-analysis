# üíß Water Quality Analysis using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze water quality data and classify whether a sample is potable (safe to drink) or not. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `water_quality_code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and conclusions.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features relevant to water quality assessment, such as:

* pH
* Hardness
* Solids
* Chloramines
* Sulfate
* Conductivity
* Organic\_carbon
* Trihalomethanes
* Turbidity
* Potability (Target Variable)
